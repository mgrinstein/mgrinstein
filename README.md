My name is Monique and I use GitHub for Software Development, Cloud Computing, Data Science & IoT projects, as well as tech courses and coding challenges.

- :octocat: My main hobbies are ballet dancing, drawing and watercolour painting.
- ðŸ’¬ I love to learn new languages! I speak English, French, Portuguese and Spanish. My German ist kaputt though...
